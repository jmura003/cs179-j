# Third Eye

A wearable aid device for assisting anyone with visual impairments. It contains: multiple sonar sensors to track approasching objects and a camera to identify faces according to a user-entered database. 

Face detection is used in order to store people in a contact list form and inform the user who is approaching. The intent is for the blind individual to know who they are talking to or who is approaching them. This concept can eventually be expanded upon to recognize strangers through reverse image-search for future prototypes. These devices will communicate about who is approaching with the user through separate speakers.
